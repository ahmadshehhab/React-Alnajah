## Overview

I built this application using React.js and connected it with a Django API using Axios, creating a seamless web experience for university students.
This project is designed with the needs of students in mind, offering a valuable resource hub for their academic journeys. 
Whether it's accessing study materials, finding references, or exploring relevant content for their subjects, 
our application aims to simplify the process. By leveraging the power of React and the flexibility of a Django backend,
we've created an intuitive platform that empowers students to excel in their studies. Welcome to a one-stop destination for all your academic resources!
